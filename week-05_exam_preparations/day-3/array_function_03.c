 * Say your input is this: {"Good", "Morning", "Vietnam"}
 * Your output should be this: {4, 7, 7}.
 * HINT: strings are terminated with a special character: '\0'.
 * So, "Good" as an array of characters would look like this: {'G', 'o', 'o', 'd', '\0'}.
 *
 * In the main function create code that demonstrates that Your function works approrpiately.
